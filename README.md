## About

MQTT is a protocol for message queueing over a network. This project provides a
client library for the Go programming language. Message-delivery guarantees are
maintained at all costs, even on (protocol, network or persistence) errors. The
client recovers from errors atomatically. Message transfers in both directions
do zero-copy.

The development was kindly sponsored by [Northvolt](https://northvolt.com), as a
gift to the open-source community.

## Introduction

Client instantiation validates its configuration only. Network management itself
operates from the *read routine*.

```go
client, err := mqtt.VolatileSession("demo-client", &mqtt.Config{
	Dialer:       mqtt.NewDialer("tcp", "mq1.example.com:1883"),
	PauseTimeout: 4 * time.Second,
	CleanSession: true,
})
if err != nil {
	log.Fatal("exit on broken setup: ", err)
}
```

A *read routine* sees inbound messages from any of the subscribed topics.

```go
for {
	message, topic, err := client.ReadSlices()
	switch {
	case err == nil:
		r, _ := utf8.DecodeLastRune(message)
		switch r {
		case 'â„ƒ', 'â„‰':
			log.Printf("%qÂ at %q", message, topic)
		}

	case errors.Is(err, mqtt.ErrClosed):
		return // client terminated

	default:
		log.Print("broker unavailable: ", err)
		time.Sleep(time.Second) // backoff
	}
}
```

The client supports confirmed message delivery with full progress disclosure.
Message transfers without an confirmation can be as simple as the following.

```go
err := client.Publish(ctx.Done(), []byte("20.8â„ƒ"), "bedroom")
if err != nil {
	log.Print("thermostat update lost: ", err)
	return
}
```

See the [examples](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pascaldekloe/mqtt#pkg-examples)
from the package documentation for more detail on error reporting and the
delivery alternatives.


## Command-Line Client

Run `go install github.com/pascaldekloe/mqtt/cmd/mqttc@latest` to build the
binary.

```
NAME
	mqttc â€” MQTT broker access

SYNOPSIS
	mqttc [options] address

DESCRIPTION
	The command connects to the address argument, with an option to
	publish a message and/or subscribe with topic filters.

	When the address does not specify a port, then the defaults are
	applied, which is 1883 for plain connections and 8883 for TLS.

OPTIONS
  -ca file
    	Amend the trusted certificate authorities with a PEM file.
  -cert file
    	Use a client certificate from a PEM file (with a corresponding
    	-key option).
  -client identifier
    	Use a specific client identifier. (default "generated")
  -key file
    	Use a private key (matching the client certificate) from a PEM
    	file.
  -net name
    	Select the network by name. Valid alternatives include tcp4,
    	tcp6 and unix. (default "tcp")
  -pass file
    	The file content is used as a password.
  -prefix string
    	Print a string before each inbound message.
  -publish topic
    	Send a message to a topic. The payload is read from standard
    	input.
  -quiet
    	Suppress all output to standard error. Error reporting is
    	deduced to the exit code only.
  -quote
    	Print inbound topics and messages as quoted strings.
  -server name
    	Use a specific server name with TLS
  -subscribe filter
    	Listen with a topic filter. Inbound messages are printed to
    	standard output until interrupted by a signal(3). Multiple
    	-subscribe options may be applied together.
  -suffix string
    	Print a string after each inbound message. (default "\n")
  -timeout duration
    	Network operation expiry. (default 4s)
  -tls
    	Secure the connection with TLS.
  -topic
    	Print the respective topic of each inbound message.
  -user name
    	The user name may be used by the broker for authentication
    	and/or authorization purposes.
  -verbose
    	Produces more output to standard error for debug purposes.

EXIT STATUS
	(0) no error
	(1) MQTT operational error
	(2) illegal command invocation
	(5) connection refused: unacceptable protocol version
	(6) connection refused: identifier rejected
	(7) connection refused: server unavailable
	(8) connection refused: bad username or password
	(9) connection refused: not authorized
	(130) close on SIGINT
	(143) disconnect on SIGTERM

EXAMPLES
	Send a message:

		echo "hello" | mqttc -publish chat/misc localhost

	Print messages:

		mqttc -subscribe "news/#" -prefix "ðŸ“¥ " :1883

	Health check:

		mqttc -tls q1.example.com:8883 || echo "exit $?"

## Standard Compliance

The implementation follows version 3.1.1 of the
[OASIS specification](http://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v3.1.1/os/mqtt-v3.1.1-os.html)
in a strict manner. Support for the originating
[IBM specification](https://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/dw/webservices/ws-mqtt/mqtt-v3r1.html)
may be added at some point in time.

There are no plans to support protocol version 5. Version 3 is lean and well
suited for IOT. The additions in version 5 may be more of a fit for backend
computing.

See the [Broker wiki](https://github.com/pascaldekloe/mqtt/wiki/Brokers) for
implementation specifics, AWS IoT users especially.
